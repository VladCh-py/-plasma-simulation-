1) Plasma.py: allows you to start calculating the motion of a charged particle in the "Plasma" of charged particles, while the simulation is displayed immediately after launch.
"Plasma" is a set of differently charged particles with the same masses. The program allows you to study the interaction of the "main" particle, which has a larger
mass and charge than ordinary particles, with "standard" particles. At different values, it is possible to observe the passage of the "main" particle through the "plasma" when it forms
A "tail" of oppositely charged particles or when the particle under study is surrounded by oppositely charged particles with a lower mass (theoretically, this result
can be interpreted as the formation of a Debye-Hückel radius).

2)Description.pdf: contains a description of the program's operation, the assumptions used, the rationale for their applicability, and the simulation results for various parameters.
